To solve this problem, we simulate the 1D linear advection of a Gaussian pulse using a finite difference method with periodic boundary conditions. The solution is visualized as a space-time heatmap using ggplot2.

### R Script Solution

```R
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)

# Parameters
xmin <- 0
xmax <- 2
nx <- 200
dx <- (xmax - xmin) / (nx - 1)
c <- 1
dt <- 0.5 * dx / c  # CFL condition for stability
tmax <- 1.5
nt <- floor(tmax / dt)

# Spatial grid
x <- seq(xmin, xmax, length.out = nx)

# Initial condition: Gaussian pulse
u0 <- exp(-20 * (x - 0.5)^2)

# Matrix to store solutions (time steps x spatial points)
u_matrix <- matrix(0, nrow = nt + 1, ncol = nx)
u_matrix[1, ] <- u0

# Time integration using FTCS scheme
u_old <- u0
for (i in 1:nt) {
    u_new <- numeric(nx)
    for (j in 1:nx) {
        left <- ifelse(j == 1, nx - 1, j - 1)
        u_new[j] <- u_old[j] - c * dt / dx * (u_old[j] - u_old[left])
    }
    u_matrix[i + 1, ] <- u_new
    u_old <- u_new
}

# Create time vector
time <- seq(0, tmax, length.out = nt + 1)

# Reshape data into long format
df <- expand.grid(x = x, t = time)
df$u <- as.vector(u_matrix)

# Plot space-time heatmap
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = t, fill = u)) +
    geom_raster() +
    scale_fill_viridis_c() +
    labs(x = "Space (x)", y = "Time (t)", fill = "Amplitude") +
    theme_minimal()
```

### Explanation

1. **Problem Setup**: We define the spatial domain `x ∈ [0, 2]` with 200 grid points and a velocity `c = 1`. The time step `dt` is chosen to satisfy the CFL condition for numerical stability.

2. **Initial Condition**: A Gaussian pulse centered at `x = 0.5` is initialized at `t = 0`.

3. **Time Integration**: Using the FTCS (Forward Time Centered Space) scheme, we update the wave amplitude at each time step. Periodic boundaries are handled by connecting the first and last spatial points.

4. **Data Storage**: The wave amplitude at every time step is stored in a matrix `u_matrix`, where rows represent time and columns represent space.

5. **Data Reshaping**: The matrix is transformed into a long-format data frame suitable for ggplot2, associating each `(x, t)` pair with its amplitude `u`.

6. **Visualization**: `geom_raster` creates the heatmap with space on the x-axis, time on the y-axis, and amplitude encoded by color. The result shows diagonal stripes illustrating the wave's motion over time.

This approach efficiently captures the wave's propagation and visualizes it as a space-time diagram, clearly displaying the advection process.
