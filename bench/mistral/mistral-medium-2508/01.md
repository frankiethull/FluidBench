# 1D Advection Simulation with Space-Time Heatmap in R

Here's an R script that simulates the 1D advection of a Gaussian pulse and visualizes it as a space-time heatmap:

```r
# Load required packages
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Simulation parameters
nx <- 100       # Number of spatial points
nt <- 100       # Number of time steps
L <- 2          # Domain length [0, 2]
c <- 1          # Advection speed
dx <- L / nx    # Spatial step
dt <- 0.01      # Time step (must satisfy CFL condition: c*dt/dx <= 1)

# Initialize spatial grid
x <- seq(0, L, length.out = nx)

# Initial condition: Gaussian pulse centered at x=0.5
sigma <- 0.1    # Width of Gaussian
x0 <- 0.5       # Initial position
u0 <- exp(-(x - x0)^2 / (2 * sigma^2))

# Initialize solution matrix (space-time)
u <- matrix(0, nrow = nt, ncol = nx)
u[1, ] <- u0   # Set initial condition

# Time-stepping loop (using upwind scheme)
for (n in 1:(nt-1)) {
  for (i in 1:nx) {
    # Upwind scheme for advection
    if (c > 0) {
      # Periodic boundary condition
      im1 <- ifelse(i == 1, nx, i - 1)
      u[n+1, i] <- u[n, i] - c * dt / dx * (u[n, i] - u[n, im1])
    } else {
      # For c < 0 (not used here but included for completeness)
      ip1 <- ifelse(i == nx, 1, i + 1)
      u[n+1, i] <- u[n, i] - c * dt / dx * (u[n, ip1] - u[n, i])
    }
  }
}

# Create time vector
t <- seq(0, (nt-1)*dt, length.out = nt)

# Reshape data for ggplot2
df <- data.frame(
  x = rep(x, each = nt),
  t = rep(t, times = nx),
  u = as.vector(u)
)

# Create space-time heatmap
ggplot(df, aes(x = x, y = t, fill = u)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "white", high = "blue", name = "Amplitude") +
  labs(title = "1D Advection of Gaussian Pulse (Space-Time Heatmap)",
       x = "Space (x)",
       y = "Time (t)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "right",
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## Explanation:

1. **Simulation Setup**:
   - We define a spatial domain from 0 to 2 with 100 points
   - The advection speed c is set to 1
   - We use periodic boundary conditions (the wave wraps around)

2. **Initial Condition**:
   - A Gaussian pulse centered at x=0.5 with width σ=0.1

3. **Numerical Scheme**:
   - We use the upwind finite difference method to solve the advection equation
   - The time step is chosen to satisfy the CFL condition (c*dt/dx ≤ 1)

4. **Data Storage**:
   - The solution is stored in a matrix where each row represents a time step
   - We then reshape this into a long-format dataframe for ggplot2

5. **Visualization**:
   - We create a space-time heatmap using `geom_tile()`
   - The x-axis shows space, y-axis shows time, and color shows amplitude
   - The result should show diagonal stripes representing the wave moving through time

The plot will show the Gaussian pulse moving diagonally from left to right as time progresses, demonstrating the advection process. The periodic boundary conditions mean the pulse will reappear on the left side after exiting the right side.
