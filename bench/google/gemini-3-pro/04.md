This is an advanced problem because it combines numerical physics with high-end 3D rendering.

To solve this, we will use the **Linearized Shallow Water Equations**. While full non-linear SWE are great for breaking dams, for a "pond ripple," the linearized version (which essentially behaves like the wave equation) is much more stable and produces smooth, beautiful concentric rings without exploding numerically.

**The Physics (Semi-Implicit Scheme):**
1.  Update Velocity ($u, v$) based on the slope of the water Height ($h$).
2.  Update Height ($h$) based on the divergence of the Velocity (how much water is flowing into/out of a cell).
3.  Apply slight damping (friction) to mimic real water.

### The R Script

**Prerequisites:** You need `rayshader` installed (`install.packages("rayshader")`). Note that `rayshader` requires a working OpenGL setup (XQuartz on Mac, standard drivers on Windows).

```R

# Simulation Parameters
nx <- 200          # Grid size x
ny <- 200          # Grid size y
nt <- 300          # Time steps (run enough for ripple to expand)
dt <- 0.1          # Time step
dx <- 1.0          # Spatial step
g  <- 9.81         # Gravity
H  <- 10.0         # Mean water depth
damping <- 0.995   # Energy loss (friction) to keep it stable

# ==========================================
# 2. INITIALIZATION
# ==========================================

# Allocate Matrices
# h = Deviation from mean water level (surface height)
h  <- matrix(0, nrow = nx, ncol = ny)
# u = Velocity in x direction
u  <- matrix(0, nrow = nx, ncol = ny)
# v = Velocity in y direction
v  <- matrix(0, nrow = nx, ncol = ny)

# Initial Condition: Gaussian Drop
# Create a peak in the center
x <- 1:nx
y <- 1:ny
grid <- expand.grid(x=x, y=y)
center_x <- nx / 2
center_y <- ny / 2

# Apply Gaussian to h matrix
# Height 2.0, width determined by denominator
h_init <- 5.0 * exp(-((grid$x - center_x)^2 + (grid$y - center_y)^2) / 20)
h <- matrix(h_init, nrow = nx, ncol = ny)

# 3. PHYSICS LOOP (Shallow Water)
# ==========================================
# We use a semi-implicit finite difference scheme (Forward-Backward).
# This is very stable for gravity waves.

### Explanation of the Code

1.  **The Physics (Linearized Shallow Water)**:
    *   We split the wave equation into two steps.
    *   **Step 1 (Momentum)**: Water accelerates "downhill." If the height $h$ is higher on the left than the right, velocity $u$ increases to the right.
    *   **Step 2 (Continuity)**: If velocity is diverging (water flowing away from a spot), the height $h$ at that spot drops. If velocity is converging, height rises.
    *   **Damping**: Real water has viscosity. Without `damping = 0.995`, the waves would bounce off walls forever and eventually become numeric noise.
2.  **Vectorization**:
    *   We calculate gradients (`dh_dx`, `du_dx`) using matrix subsetting (e.g., `u[2:nx, ]`). This calculates the difference between every neighbor pair in the grid simultaneously, which is vastly faster than a loop.
3.  **Rayshader Visualization**:
    *   `height_shade`: Converts the height matrix $h$ into a base color map.
    *   `add_shadow(ray_shade)`: Calculates ray-traced shadows based on the sun position. This is crucial for making the waves look 3D.
    *   `plot_3d`: The heavy lifter. It turns the matrix into a 3D mesh.
    *   `water = TRUE`: This adds a specific reflective shader to the surface, giving it that "glossy" liquid look.
    *   **Result**: An interactive 3D window should pop up showing a metallic/liquid blue ripple expanding from the center.
